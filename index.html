    <p>Hello my name is Andy Yong and this is my personal introduction</p>
    <li>A favorite culture that I am not native to, is the Japanese culture because of its rich history and traditions.
        They also have an eye and appreciation for art, nature and asthetics.</li>
    <li> Jesus Christ, as he is a central figure of Christianity. Johan Cruyff as he introduced the devlopment of modern day football (soccer)  </li>
    <li>A meal that can represent me can either be a tamale or chow mein because I am mixed.
        <br>(half guatemalan & half chinese)</li>
    <li>I feel most creative when I can solve a puzzle or problem that I have been stuck on. </li>
